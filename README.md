**Github Hacks**

I love playing with things and hence tweaking with technology is what I love to do. So I have written this fun node.js script to hack your Github Contribution Graph, with this you can mark 1000+ contributions in just a couple of seconds. 

I have developed this just for educational & fun purposes so please don't use it for producing any false claims.
